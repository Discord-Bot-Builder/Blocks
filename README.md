# DBB Blocks
Here you can find the blocks created by the community. Some blocks can be added to Discord Bot Builder and others will be in the dark forever of how weird they are.


## How to Install:

1. Download the blocks by clicking on the green button "Code" and then click "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the ZIP and open the "blocks" and "weird blocks" folders to find the mods you would like to add.
3. Copy them and go to your bot folder -> "blocks" folder and paste them there.
